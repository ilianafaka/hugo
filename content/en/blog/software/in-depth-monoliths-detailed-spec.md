#### **What Is video tutorial software?**

Video tutorials software lets you create asynchronous instructional videos, such as live-action footage, animation and screencasts, giving step-by-step guidance for specific activities. You can also use it to trim, edit, manipulate or enhance your videos to create customized and relevant learning and development content to empower and engage your teams.

#### **Why do you need video tutorial software?**
When it comes to employee training, video tutorials are just one of the many options. You can choose from various training methods, so the important thing here is to identify the most suitable option that works for your employees.

#### **How do video tutorials hold up against these methods? Let’s find out.**

Video tutorials vs. other employee training methods
First, let’s acquaint you with the basics.

Besides video tutorials, here are the other types of employee training methods:

* On-the-job training: This training focuses on the practical skills required to do the job. Companies typically provide on-the-job training to new hires to reduce time-to-productivity. Common examples include internships, rotations and job shadowing.
* Mentoring: Here, a supervisor or mentor takes on the responsibility of coaching an employee, following a structured curriculum that uses a culmination of training methods to create opportunities for employee growth and make new employees feel welcomed and supported. Employees learn by watching the mentor do things in real time.
* Simulators: This type of training is ideal for jobs requiring specific skills to operate complex machinery, like in the aviation or medical fields. Simulations are designed to reflect real-life work situations to give trainees a first-hand experience of what they are likely to face on the job.
* Role-playing: Here, a trainer and a trainee realistically act out hypothetical work scenarios. Commonly used for industries that require frequent client interaction or involve customer service, it helps employees practice handling difficult situations and better react to situations in real life.
* eLearning: This training is primarily computer-based and delivered from an online medium. Employees can go through the content and activities at their own pace, plus you can incorporate interactive activities like quizzes to boost engagement and appraise the training effectiveness and employee progress. 
While all these employee training methods are great and effective, video tutorials still stand out.

The benefits of using video tutorials to enhance employee training
Here are the key benefits of using video tutorials in your employee training process:

#### **Better engagement retention**
A well-presented and concise video is the more effective way of presenting information, especially when compared to text-based training or tutorials. Studies have found viewers retain 95 percent of a message when they watch it in a video format compared to ten percent retention when reading the same information in text format. 

People learn better when the information is communicated through a visual medium.

#### **Reduced Cost of employee training** 
Large-scale companies, especially ones with multiple offices and locations, typically earmark a significant part of their training budget to get employees in front of customers. For example, classroom-based training involves traveling and lodging, which are all expensive and non-negotiable expenses. 

On the other hand, video tutorials do away with the need for in-person training, leading to significant savings over a determined period of time. Case in point — Microsoft’s internal video portal helped the company reduce its classroom training costs from nearly $320 an hour per employee to just $17.

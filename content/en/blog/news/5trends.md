### Latest Software Development Trends in 2023
Since digital products determine the creation of sustainable and adaptable businesses, software developers and IT specialists play a critical role in building the post-pandemic world. Let’s look at the tools and strategies they use to achieve better results.

### 1. Blockchain Goes Beyond Cryptocurrency 
The time when blockchain technology was associated with cryptocurrency only is gone. Blockchain is now one of the key trends in the software industry. Experts note a staggering growth of blockchain adoption in many fields. The thing is that this distributed, decentralized system provides an exceptional level of security and transparency for various transactions, and can be applicable to many business sectors beyond fintech.

Here are some examples:

* Supply chain monitoring systems in logistics, automotive, agriculture, oil and gas industry.
* Accounting software systems ensuring the traceability of energy consumption
* Platforms for intellectual property protection.
* Software systems for secure electronic voting.
* Thus, a growing number of blockchain-based applications will increasingly emerge in various fields.

### 2. Cloud Computing Facilitates Collaboration
The apparent trend is that software development companies will more actively use cloud-native solutions for app development, team management, and communication. These are software products and services hosted in public, private, or hybrid clouds. They are infrastructure-agnostic and can run on multiple servers, so any company can easily adopt them.

Based on containers and microservices, cloud-native software solutions provide flexibility and scalability, and improve the productivity of software development teams.

It should be noted that the demand for cloud services and tools has grown due to the necessity to facilitate remote work. Companies have had to implement the appropriate infrastructure and support employees in creating a work environment in their home offices.

### 3. Python Takes the Lead 
For many years, the list of the most used programming languages among software developers worldwide was dominated by JavaScript. Since 2020, Python has been rushing to the top of that list, and in December 2021, it managed to become the leader.  

According to the latest updates of the TIOBE index and the PYPL index in June 2022, Python was the top computer language. It seems Python’s growing popularity will continue well into 2023 and beyond, as it is the favorite language of developers creating software solutions with AI- and ML-based features. As mentioned earlier in this article, artificial intelligence stands proudly among the top software development trends for 2023.

### 4. TensorFlow Boosts AI Development 
Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is no longer considered futuristic as it’s applied in many business sectors. Ground-breaking AI applications can process images, detect objects, and recognize human speech. 

In 2021, the global artificial intelligence market reached a value of **$56.5 billion**, according to IMARC Group. By 2027, this figure could reach **$308.5 billion**.  

When creating such software systems, programmers implement deep learning concepts using special AI libraries and frameworks. And one of the essential trends in software development this year is the use of TensorFlow for AI development. 

TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. This complex mathematical tool is currently the leading platform for building and training neural networks. On the one hand, this is a comprehensive ecosystem of the libraries, tools, and various resources needed to create intelligent models and algorithms. On the other hand, the framework is flexible and user-friendly, making it easy for developers to build advanced software.

###### Why is TensorFlow so popular? Because it:

* Supports several programming languages, including **Java**, **C++**, and **Python**. 
* Runs on multiple CPUs, GPUs, and mobile operating systems.
* Can be deployed to the cloud, locally, in a browser, or on a device.
* Has built-in intuitive APIs.
* Ensures immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
* Allows for conducting complex research experiments.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Eliminates Management Issues
Modern application development environments are intricate, with all the clusters, microservices, containers, APIs, serverless functions, and interdependencies that developers should keep track of. In such conditions, DevOps specialists are under constant pressure as they must ensure app stability and security. At the same time, developers are required to accelerate code development and even faster deployment.

That’s why DevOps teams are turning to IaC — a method of using code to manage, automate, configure, and drive continuous improvement on dynamic computing resources. Traditionally, organizations relied on a few highly skilled individuals who understood what their code depended on and how it was delivered, which resulted in bottlenecks and dependencies. The IaC practice eliminates such issues.

Using IaC, the DevOps team can create a single, trusted code base for an organization that will be used to track that apps are deployed according to security standards. Implementing IaC also allows teams to track inconsistencies in code, making it easier to fix vulnerabilities. This approach makes it possible to implement the best configuration practices within the organization’s security policies and rules.

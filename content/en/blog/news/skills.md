## **What are software developer skills?**
Software developer skills are the technical capabilities an individual learns to create successful programs and applications. They typically involve using mathematical knowledge and a capacity for problem-solving to write source code, which is the sequence of words and symbols that allows a program to function. There are many types of skills to learn, including digital tools and computer systems. Many software developers learn them through classes in a computer science degree program or certification course.

### 5 software developer skills
Here are 5 technical skills needed to become a software developer:

#### **1. Coding languages**
Coding languages are the different types of source code a person can write for a software program. It's important for software developers to specialize in at least one type of coding language so they can increase the number of job opportunities they can receive, as hiring managers often expect candidates to have expertise. To choose a language to learn, try to determine which type of program aligns with your interests. For example, some options may work better for mobile application development while others may suit video game design instead.

##### Here are some common coding languages to learn:

* JavaScript: This option helps developers design the system for an interactive website application, like a webpage that displays certain information after a user clicks on a button.

* HyperText markup language (HTML): You can use this standardized option to display text and image content on a website application, such as paragraphs, bulleted lists and charts.

* Cascading styles sheets (CSS): This option allows you to add fonts, colors and spacing to text content on a website application. As a result, many developers know HTML and CSS and use both languages at the same time.

* Python: This option is a multi-faceted programming language that allows you to accomplish varied software development tasks, including code writing for an entire program or tracking errors in the language. It has a simple structure, so it may be easier to learn than some options.

* C++: This programming language can help you develop programs that optimize hardware capabilities, such as medical equipment software. Many video game developers use C++ as they can design complex gaming systems with high-quality computer graphics.

* Java: This language can allow you to create programs and applications across different computer systems. Video game developers also use Java to create high-quality video games, as it has a similar structure to C++ with fewer complexities.


#### **2. Database knowledge**
Databases are electronic systems that allow individuals to organize and structure information, particularly records for a company. Software developers must know how to search for information, input new lines of data in a table format and update a system with new materials. They also understand how to secure a database and backup data to preserve a company's information during any unforeseen circumstances. To operate a database, it may be helpful to learn a standardized source code called Structured Query Language (SQL), which can allow you to operate varied systems for different companies.


#### **3. Data structures and algorithms**
Data structures are different organizational methods for storing information in a database, while algorithms describe the process required to complete tasks. Software developers often know many data structures and algorithms to determine which combination can help them optimize information in a program's code. For instance, a completed array structure can store different variations of the same type of data, such as a writing program that stores font information. If the developer used the correct algorithm, users can choose a type of font and its size.

To learn different data structures, it may be helpful to take a relevant course that teaches you how to build and implement them in a program. Here are some certification courses you can take:

* Coursera's Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

* Udemy's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

* EdX's Professional Certificate in Data Structures and Algorithms

* Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree Certification


#### **4. Source control**
Source control management (SCM) describes a system that helps a software development team track updates and changes to a program's coding language. It allows each developer an opportunity to work on the code separately, then merge their efforts into one version. SCM systems can generate a list of code revisions and help you restore a language to a previous state if necessary. It may be helpful to learn how to use a type of SCM system, as companies often require software developers to work in teams on the same coding projects.

Companies and individual developers often use a program called Git, which is an SCM application that allows you to store different versions of a program code in one folder system. It uses a branch system to organize each project, meaning a primary branch represents the original version of a code, while any additional branches that connect to it represent alterations or modifications. Git is also an open-source program, meaning it's available for anyone to use.


#### **5. Testing procedures**
Every software program requires an intricate testing process before a company can release it to consumers. It involves using a series of digital tools to ensure that a product functions and fulfills its design requirements. It also involves checking a program's ability to function on different hardware devices and store confidential information. As companies often design their testing processes based on a few critical components, it may be helpful for a software developer to understand fundamental aspects before applying to job positions.

##### Here are three components of software testing that developers know:

* Unit testing: This test involves evaluating individual lines or areas of code to determine if they require modification. Developers often create a different unit test for every project they complete to ensure they examine a program's key elements.

* Integration testing: Software developers use this testing process to determine whether they can merge different areas of a program's code successfully. They can also use integration testing to observe how one software program interacts with the code of another.

* System testing: After integration testing is complete, an external testing professional typically conducts this process to determine if a product fulfills user expectations. It's important for a software developer to understand the steps of this process, as testing professionals often communicate critical suggestions for alterations.
